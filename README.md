Simple game based on [Godot's tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/). I wrote my version in Rust, and added a few features afterwards:

- Background
- Sound effects
- Bonus points for bouncing off of consecutive mobs
- A popup tracking bounce streak
- A high score
- Varying sized mobs
- Pause screen
